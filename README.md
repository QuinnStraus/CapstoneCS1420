This project aimed to predict student difficulty in solving a given math assignment. 
I accomplished this using a large open dataset from the ASSISTments program, which I processed and passed through a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. 
I chose this project because I have studied STEM education through coursework at Brown, and I am building a startup that provides educational resources to STEM students. 
I was, therefore, curious to see how well a model would predict a student’s future performance from their past assignments since that prediction capacity could be valuable for us.
